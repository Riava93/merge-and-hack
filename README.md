# HTML5 Game Jam Template!

##### See the example output in your browser console
```
  // from app.js
  var game = new Game();
  game.start();
```

##### Or to run the game from your command line
```
  $ npm start
  // This will run the simulator.coffee file in the root of the project
```

##### Both should yield the same output and allow you to work with your game logic with or without a browser which maybe be easier for running fast simulations
